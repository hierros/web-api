Question:
Give one reason (there are many) OAuth tokens should not be granted in the
main flow, assuming the user has sent in the correct credentials.


Answer:
Keeping OAuth token authorization outside of the main flow and
having the additional proxy makes OAuth more secure because then that proxy
can be the only thing able to decrypt the access and refresh tokens to the Resource Server.
