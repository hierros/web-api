Postman Response Header

alt-svc → quic=":443"; ma=604800; v="30,29,28,27,26,25"
Alternative Servics for HTTP, which allow an origin's resource to be
authoritatively available at a separate network location

alternate-protocol → 443:quic,p=1
The Alternate-Protocol HTTP response header indicates that a server supports SPDY.
Then on the second request the client will use SPDY instead of HTTP.

cache-control → private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
Implies that the content is considered stale (and must be re-fetched) immediately

content-encoding → gzip
Compliant browsers will announce what methods are supported to the server before
downloading the correct format; browsers that do not support compliant
compression method will download uncompressed data. The most common compression
schemes include gzip

content-length → 6771
The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body,
in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD
method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request
been a GET.

content-type → application/json; charset=UTF-8
Information about type of returned data, ex::JSON

date → Sat, 13 Feb 2016 01:30:40 GMT
The time and date of the response in GMT time

etag → "3z2GbiG39NRdo416x8jooTTBAqY/PBeSU5TRLIb0xuzf6D9CVX4FOFw"
An ETag is basically just a checksum for a file that semantically changes
when the content of the file changes

expires → Sat, 13 Feb 2016 01:30:40 GMT
The standard way to specify when an asset expired

server → GSE
The Server response-header field contains information about the software used by
the origin server to handle the request. The field can contain multiple product
tokens (section 3.8) and comments identifying the server and any significant
subproducts. The product tokens are listed in order of their significance for
identifying the application.

status → 200
This class of status code indicates that the client's request was successfully
received, understood, and accepted.

vary → Origin, X-Origin
Vary response header allows a cache to determine if a cached (still fresh) response may be returned for a subsequent request, based on whether or not the new request's headers match those that were sent when the the previously response was originally cached.

x-content-type-options → nosniff
The only defined value, "nosniff", prevents Internet Explorer and Google Chrome from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.

x-frame-options → SAMEORIGIN
no rendering if origin mismatch.

x-xss-protection → 1; mode=block
This header enables the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into most recent web browsers. It's usually enabled by default anyway, so the role of this header is to re-enable the filter for this particular website if it was disabled by the user
